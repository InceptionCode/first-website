              The reason is simple really. I believe programming is more than just a skill, it is a way to provide solutions. 
              It is a way to improve lives in numerous ways. 
              Most importantly to me, it is an art or extraordinary creation. 
              That creation can be used to empower, inspire, and change in multiple ways.
              I would love to play a major role in creating art in order to entertain or provide any other service.

                At the time I was hunting for a start. An internship anywhere would do for me.

                an Atlanta Web Development & Internet Consulting company. 
                I was given the luxury of a tour with the owner. It was such a great experience and I was able to take in and learn so much. 
                I came in looking for a spot in the company but left out with a few clients plus knowledge I needed.
                To me I got a better deal.
                <br><br>
                Detective Amandy Busby happened to be my 1st referred client from AirTight. 
                I&#39;ll let Amanda and Mr. Ward at AirTight take it from here.

                &#34;Hope you remember that I came into your office asking for assistance in developing my website. 
                You recommended Darrell Washington Jr.
                Let me start by saying Mr. Washington was very professional and did a tremendous job on the site, he walked me through it like I didn&#39;t have a clue, explained to me what I would be getting out of the website for my money&#39;s worth, which is very unusual in this day and time.
                I&#39;m very pleased to say he did an awesome job and I would recommend him to anyone.
                If you would like to take a look at what he did I will be happy give you administrative rights, and of course, let me know if there&#39;s something he could have done that would have been a better approach.&#34;

                I truly believe that this is a collaborative effort. Therefore as my client, you must be walked through each process and step. I know you hired me to handle all the technical stuff you don&#39;t understand. I know you don&#39;t have the time nor want to learn this stuff. That&#39;s where I come in. To create a working site, quickly and effectively. Also, to ensure you can follow along and manage the site as well. <br /> <br/>
                I believe Mr. Ward recognized my potential, talent, and work ethic.
                Maybe the most important thing he noticed was how much I cared about the end users and my clients&#39; satisfaction.
                <br>
                &#34;Hey, Detective Busby.
                I&#39;m so glad to hear that it worked out well with Darrell.
                He&#39;s got a ton of talent for such a young guy.
                I know he&#39;s going to go far in his career.
                Thanks for letting me know about your experience. I&#39;ll continue to refer work to Darrell.&#34;

                 This project signifies the importance of what I do.
                 The right website, the right branding, and message can shape a nation and create a movement.
                 I think this client for allowing me to be a big part of this possibly huge cultural shift.
                 It was one hell of an experience designing and building the site from the ground up with Jason. 
                 <br><br>
                 We often times took hours on end just brainstorming and putting the pieces together.
                 This project pushed me to a level that I know will be beneficial to my future clients.
                 My ability to communicate, innovate, and put forth ideas skyrocketed after the project.
                 My skills in running a business in general developed and I took in a lot.
                 I&#39;m confident that Mr. Jason himself feels the same way.

              I run into clients who are tech savvy and know most terms and trends. 
              They make demands or request features that may be way overboard.
              Instead of just saying no I give out a reason.
              Often times I ask up front,
              <br> 
              &#34;what is your objective and what is it that you want to show?&#34; 
              <br><br>
              That usually shifts the conversation into a business plan discussion.
              To be honest that&#39;s what a website should be about, the business and what it can do for the business.
              Often times clients focus on how fun, cool, and interactive the website can be. No no no, let&#39;s focus on what we really want.

              Mrs. Jacqui my client was current on a lot of new features.
              She had such a great mind that poured out great ideas.
              It was amazing working with her. Every day brought a surprise but we often times got off track.
              Especially when trying to understand what she was asking for.
              The good news is that we both would redirect our focus on what the site needed instead of what we wanted on the site.
