# first-website
This was my first website that I made completely from scratch. I actually had it up live and running for over a year now. I learned so much from the time I spent building the website to deploying it. It was extremely fun and motivating.
I have recently taking the website down for multiple reasons. One reason being that it honestly wasn't a good site to use for my own branding.
Also, I feel as if this is a better suited marketing tool for employers to easily view the code base and the actual website running on Digital Ocean [here.](http://darrellwashingtonjr.com/InceptionCode/home.html)

## Contribution
I don't plan on refactoring or making changes to this website. However, in the near future I will be making a whole new remodeled website. 
I would love for you to leave your thoughts and suggestions on the code itself. Any tools, tips or advice will be greatly appreciated. 
Thanks!!
