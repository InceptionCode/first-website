          I will start off by saying, this will be a short post. I mean really short, barely a five-minute read. No, this post will not dive deep into how Tachyons works. No, this post will not show you how to install Tachyons. However, this post, if you keep an open mind, may persuade you to use it and understand how beneficial it can be in your workflow.

          <br><br>
          Picture this: You are young, let’s say in your early twenties, and you have the desire to code.
          It could be that you saw the Treehouse ads on YouTube, or you may have close friends and family that are into “developing something”.
          However, you just can’t put your finger on what it is that you want to pursue.
          Now, at this point, you have no idea about the options available to you.
          You go through Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, podcasts, blogs etc… just to put your finger on this new idea that you want to pursue.
          Soon enough, inspiration hits you, the bulb in your head lights up and illuminates the whole room.
          Guess what? You want to be a Web Developer — but where do you start?

        I ran into a little problem.
        I understood enough HTML to markup any page.
        I may not be a JavaScript master but simple interactions or behaviors aren’t a difficult task for me to make happen.
        Plus, jQuery and the documentation, tutorials, and resources built around that framework can get me up and run on anything.
        I’m getting craftier with CSS3, well I should say SASS.
        All these starting foundations are great.
        I had this feeling I couldn’t shake for a while.

          A while back I felt as if I should stay away from GitHub let alone the entire community.
          Mainly because I felt as if I was not at the community level (whatever that is).
          Me not understanding Git was a horrible excuse on top of that I didn’t know what to put in a repository.
          Finally, I felt like I couldn’t collab with anyone or gain awareness from my repo’s.
          I kept getting pushed to market myself and get placed in a position for opportunities.
          The thing is how could I?
