          Everyone has something they are shooting for or working towards. Everyone has a creative artist in them. 
          Unfortunately, most of us allow the spontaneous, creative side of us to be beaten by adults or other authority. 
          We feel as if these ideas and feelings should be left in a child's place. 
          Some of us fight back against the temptation to do what our heart longs to do. It may be because we feel pressure and doubt from others.
          It ultimately falls back on us giving in to our own doubts and fears. 
          It sucks when we can get in the way of ourselves and become our own enemy. 
          <br><br>
          How can you win against yourself? You may have to enjoy being miserable.

          My heart had been beating for years now. I started at fifteen but wouldn't finish until five years later.
          From the constant lies, I told myself to the life issues that became a distraction, I couldn't finish. 
          So why now? How did I finally find the courage to take a big leap forward. It was simple, I saw myself dead with nothing attached to my name.

        One of the best moments of my life took place awhile back. 
        An interview that may very well set me on the path I wish to be on. 
        The time was 10:03 AM when the call from 
        <a class="dib link grow no-underline-hover outline-0-focus trim-color hover-red" href="http://randyjmitchell.com/" target="blank">
          Randy J. Mitchell 
        </a> 
        (yes that is his website go and check it out) came.
        A guy anyone can look up too. 
        He was featured on big names in the industry: TechCrunch, Huffington Post, BET, and VentureBeat. 
        I could go on with his list of accomplishments but you get the point. The guy is an outstanding Software Engineer and Entrepreneur.
        <br><br>
        However, what seems to me as a huge list of accomplishments was perceived differently by Randy himself. When talking to him it seemed as if he was a cool guy who just enjoyed life and what he does...

          I believe everyone goes through the same stages in life. 
          Those stages only come up when you are closing in on your dreams.
          The key words here are CLOSING IN. 
          The closer you are the stronger resistance comes to clip your wings, then laugh as you fall on your face.
          Yes, it sucks to know that while you are doing good life will try to ruin everything but it’s true.
          There is a way to get around this though. Are you ready to find out how to win this constant game called “Life”?

        I had this feeling I couldn’t shake for a while.
        This pill labeled “DT,” I just couldn’t swallow.
        The thing that worries me, even more, was that I wasn’t physically sick, maybe somewhat paralyzed but there was no need for the pill.
        The form of mental sickness that I had was created by me, and only can be fixed by me.
        Doubt is a hard pill to swallow. 
        It’s hard to realize that you have it and you need to take it for what it is.

          This will probably be the shortest post ever on this site.
          But I just had to say my day has been phenomenal.
          I am truly amazed that I was posted and displayed on

          I enjoy everything on the site and I feel kinda famous being posted on there.
          I’ll keep working and sharing.
